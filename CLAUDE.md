## Principles

- Simplicity above all. The best solution is the simplest one that fully solves the problem. Speculative abstractions age poorly — earn complexity through proven need.
- Hold yourself to a staff engineer standard. Only propose changes you would confidently ship to production. Challenge your own work before presenting it.
- If a solution feels wrong, iterate until it doesn't. Demand excellence.

## Code

- Understand before modifying. Read the surrounding code, follow its conventions, and let consistency guide your decisions.
- Build from small, composable pieces. Colocate what belongs together. Let the type system carry its weight — if a type is hard to express, rethink the design.
- Formatting is tooling's job. Never fight the formatter.
- Solve the stated problem — not adjacent ones. A bug fix is not a refactoring opportunity. If the right fix requires broadening scope, ask first.

## Architecture

- Extend before inventing. Prefer growing an existing module over creating a new one unless there is a clear, distinct boundary.
- Dependencies flow inward. Shared packages never depend on application code.
- Abstractions are extracted, not predicted. Duplication across multiple call sites earns a shared utility; a single use case does not.

## Git

- Imperative mood, atomic commits. Each commit represents one logical change, described by what it does — not what you did.
- Feature branches for non-trivial work. Never force-push shared branches.
- Review your own diff before committing. Read it as a reviewer would.

## Workflow

For non-trivial work (three or more steps), enter planning mode before writing code. Delegate research to subagents — one focused task per agent — and keep the main context window clean. Summarize at milestones, not line by line.
