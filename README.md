## Development

Each service has its own scripts:

```bash
pnpm dev          # Watch mode
pnpm build        # Production build
pnpm test         # Run tests
pnpm lint         # Lint with Biome
```

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions runs on push to `main` and on pull requests.

A successful CI run triggers deployment to DigitalOcean App Platform.
